						This originated as the 2006 painting <em>Girl with Balloon</em>, which Banksy gifted to a friend. This was rare in itself, as it was a unique canvas work, rather than a print.
						When the painting was sold at auction in 2018, Banksy (or one of his associates) activated a remote self-destruct sequence, shredding roughly half of the painting. Banksy then renamed
						the piece <em>Love is in the Bin</em>This was not Banksy's first destructive work of art. Though one could argue that graffiti is a form of vandalism, Bansky had previously stenciled over 
						canvases in his <em>Corrupted Oils</em> series. This piece was different, in that it was both a live piece of performance art and a transformation of one artwork into another. 
						This fits with Banksy's style, but stands out as one of the most memorable artworks of our time due to its unique concept and execution.
